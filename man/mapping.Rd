\usage{
extract_ipv4_mapped(x, keep_ipv6 = FALSE)

embed_ipv4_mapped(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{\link{ip_address}} vector}

\item{keep_ipv6}{A logical indicating whether IPv6 addresses that are
not IPv4-mapped should be kept or converted to \code{NA}. If \code{FALSE}
(the default), the returned vector will only contain IPv4 addresses.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link{ip_address}} vector
}
\description{
\code{extract_ipv4_mapped()} extracts an IPv4 address from an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address

\code{embed_ipv4_mapped()} embeds an IPv4 address within an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
}
\details{
Addresses already in the target address space are unaffected by
these functions.
}
\examples{
x <- ip_address(c("192.168.0.1", "::ffff:192.0.2.128", "2001:db8::"))

extract_ipv4_mapped(x)

embed_ipv4_mapped(x)

# keep_ipv6 option prevents lossy mappings
embed_ipv4_mapped(extract_ipv4_mapped(x, keep_ipv6 = TRUE))
